# Decibel

###User Story
#####Essentially, this idea was born of another--a friendship application that would allow people with similar, but platonic, friendships to meet up over common interests. After a couple of days working on my original idea, it became quickly apparent that this would be a massive undertaking, and I would not have the time nor resources to complete it as a General Assembly project within a week. Even then, with my personal comfort towards Rails/Angular and the difficulty of managing a one-to-one relationship with MongoDB, I had to refactor my plans. Thus my idea for Decibel was born.
#####Decibel is aimed towards people who buy tickets for concerts but have no friends within their current social circle to attend those events. By that token, they access Decibel, post the concert they are planning to attend and meet other people within their circle who will be attending said concert. It's also a way to post up tickets for concerts for sale. The Facebook authentication adds a level of intimacy and user responsibility--there will always be a verified person on the other end.

###Technologies Used
#####MongoDB
#####Express
#####NodeJS
#####AngularJS

###Next Steps
#####If I were to expand this as a functioning, usable app, I would add SongKick API to search artists and actual, ongoing concerts. Additionally, I would separate posts by location. I think that I would approach this app with Rails and Angular to build out user profiles as well. As it stands, it's a functioning, sturdy application that works as a skeleton for what Decibel could be. However, I desired to work on my MEAN Stack efforts and truly push myself beyond my comfort zone.
